*****************
Welcome to std_e!
*****************


**std_e** (for "standard extended") is a C++17 library. It contains general-purpose data structures and algorithms. To get an overview of the main functionalities, take a look at :ref:`highlights`. You can also browse the :ref:`folders` for a brief description of functionnalities folder by folder. More detailed descriptions of the functionnalities are described in the :ref:`user_manual`. Finally, some algorithms are described, specified and analyzed in detail in :ref:`reference`.

The following documentation assumes a good knowledge of the C++ standard library and recent C++ constructs.

Installation
------------

**std_e** needs a C++17 compiler (in particular, gcc>=8 and clang>=8 are known to work). It only depends on the standard library. See :ref:`installation` for more details.
